# Simulation of Probabilities

A combination of pseudo-random and hardware-based random number generators is demonstrated using a linear congruential generator and system-generated performance time counter of the order in nanoseconds. Thereby, a compilations of some standard algorithmic transformations is presented, with mathematical justications and Python implementations. The idea is to first generate a Standard Uniform Random Variable and then transform it into another Random Variable which follows a specified probability law/distribution, by using an underlying mathematical algorithm.
